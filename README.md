# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

# Development commands

- Compile: `npx hardhat compile`
- [Local] Run networks: `npx hardhat node`
- [Local] Deploy script: `npx hardhat run scripts/[script-name].js --network localhost`
